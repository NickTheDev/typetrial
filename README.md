# Typetrial 
Typetrial is a modern typing test app. It is built for use on desktop as well as mobile, and is fully responsive. 

# Exams
To start an exam in Typetrial, start typing in the input box. A timer for two minutes will begin, and when it reaches zero the exam will end and a report will be generated.

After starting the exam, a sentence will be displayed on the screen and you will be prompted to type it in. After typing it, clicking the space bar will shuffle the sentence randomly.

# Speed calculations.
In an effort to calculate an accurate words per minute speed, a certian procedure is used. The characters typed in total will be divided by five, to get the average amount of words typed. The amount of words with typos will be subracted from the average word total. The word average will finally be divided by 120 seconds.
